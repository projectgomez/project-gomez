#Project Gomez

##What is it?

Envisioned as a mechanical keyboard with a battery and integrated ARM SoC (Raspberry Pi-family), "Gomez" is a *lot* like the old **Cambridge/Sinclair Z88**:

or **Tandy/Radio Shack [Model 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prl6D7bqQo8)**:

..but really, more like Alan Kay's proposed '[DynaBook](https://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/Kay72a.pdf)'.

###Today, it's just a bunch of bits.


##Who is it for?
This thing I'm calling 'Project Gomez' could be for anyone who wants or needs a mechanical keyboard with a basic (very basic) operating system installed.

This is very much function over fashion.
